Apologies, [Mortimer & Whitehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_%26_Whitehouse:_Gone_Fishing) fans, this isn't a blog about fishing.

Instead, even though it may be less perfect than that awesome show, this is a checkpoint blog, laying down what I, Peter Marshall, Developer Relations Director and source of facial expressions, believes organizations have to do to have an effective community. And what I think it stands for is "CASTS".

Hence, the fishing.

I am not the first to try and crack this nut / spin this yarn / tackle these Klingon dingleberries. DevRel as a function is ever-developing; I will not be the last to throw in my pennies unto this fountain of opinion.

Yet, in an unnervingly radical departure from my usual inner-critic, I feel that perhaps I may be uniquely positioned to offer up this model to you for your kind consideration.

In 2019 I was fortunate enough to have been thrust headlong into Silicon Valley, rather like an uncontrollable fork-lift truck entering a hedge in a field. I was gifted the opportunity to observe major players in the space. Recognizable community leaders who have worked at Informix, Confluent, Fivetran, SAP, SAS, Overstock, Vertica, DataStax, Qubole, Amazon, Elastic, Cloudera, Hortonworks, Sun Microsystems, Gridgain, Imply, Yelp, Teradata, Microsoft, and Decodable. I started knowing nothing, an outsider on the inside track, and now, four years later, DevRel has become my passion, too.

## It starts with you.

In 2022, we met in Salt Lake City with a documentation expert, [Charles Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesosmith/), and awesome advocate [Sergio Ferragut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-ferragut-3241b14?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAC9j4wBDM03E-o_9hxAAFqG7Eyzsv4bhNM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BlzjqckOHSti5n%2BCTVZWhhw%3D%3D) with a seemingly simple task: "What is the Developer journey?"

Three days and thirteen 18-feet-wide whiteboards and a detour into the world of [Wheeler Dealers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Dealers) later, we came to answer a core question for any service-oriented team: who is our customer?

We found ourselves present at a real-life Eureka Moment: the birth of the "Cool Kid".

* They have intense enthusiasm and high energy for topics of interest and exhibit highly developed and highly specific language.
    
* Inquisitive by nature, they absorb a wealth of information on topics they find intellectually stimulating before others do, and can apply this knowledge to various situations.
    
* Rapidly processing a vast amount of information, they demonstrate advanced comprehension and abstract thinking.
    
* They enjoy complexity, generating original ideas and solutions to problems, as well as discovering new ways of approaching problem-solving. They can identify patterns and connect concepts in unique ways.
    
* Desiring freedom, space, and a bit of peace and quiet (!) they learn and solve problems autonomously.
    

Like Beatles fans around a PanAm Boeing 707, we all jumped from our proverbial bathtubs and screamed "That's it! that's our developer!"

This is no made-up persona. Within the boundaries of "reasonable creative license", it's based on a paper from 2006 by Sandra Manning called "[Gifted Students](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ724632.pdf)". And the list of traits you will find therein is itself an aggregation of research stretching back nearly 30 years.

Together with the journey map, something magical happened: CASTS was born.

## CASTS

### Capability

This is what gives Developers a topic to obsess about. In our case, it's the "core" of an Open Core Community Company – [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org).

It's the core that enables people to solve a problem in their work or at home. It's the spatula you ever knew you needed. It's the manifestation of hope.

This capability is what developers want to spend hours sitting in libraries reading about. The art of the code and how it's been put together. The people who built it. The use of MMORPG character names for classes (sorry – an inside joke). It's the possibility that this thing could be connected to a beautiful web of possibility, stretching from Apache Datasketches to IoT and back again via graph theory.

DevRel as a team is here to know everything that there is to know about it, to be the embodiment of the repository: look at us, and we can tell you what it is, how it fits, how it works...

...and how it could change your life!

### Autonomy

Autonomizing activities in Developer Relations gets past all that rhetorical fluffy nonsense and makes stuff actionable. It provides a tome of knowledge for the Cool Kids to read. Informal and formal training focuses their excited energy so that they can go and solve a problem.

(Or even just know what problems it's good to solve.)

Remembering that developers are more than capable of using personal experimentation and research to apply core capabilities, DevRel tops this up. It provides the community with reliable and well-known authors who provide practical content that works.

In doing so, DevRel is a [Remmington Fuzzaway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dCjOdoZibk) that gives developers tools and content that addresses the mundane and allows developers to focus on their passion: intricate problem-solving.

### Seeing

Being a Cool Kid can be lonely. So a key reason DevRel exists is to see that isolation and – at speed – address it. Through DevRel, people feel their requests and concerns are heard – that they matter.

This is what makes DevRel personal. It reduces the fear that comes with the unknown and attaches developers to a like-minded, low-threat person that will give them confidence in their idea and their abilities. It helps them realise their potential. Things like:

* Implementing the core capabilities to solve a problem
    
* Speaking in a public forum
    
* Writing something practical to help other people
    
* Solving problems or answering questions
    
* Contributing some code
    

A DevRel seer might identify someone creating content for a specific project in their business. They shake hands and talk about red socks (a strange custom in the United States that still baffles me). Within a few days, they are pals. "Did you know [Hellmar Becker](https://blog.hellmar-becker.de/)? He puts all that kind of stuff on his blog. Do you want to meet him?" Hey presto, our lonely developer is connected with someone who can help them put that content in a public blog. Huzzah! Let the UGC program commence.

Or perhaps DevRel will spot people who are new to using the core capabilities. They reach out and assess what is preventing them from realizing their full potential. We recognise their need, talk to them about what they're trying to achieve, and point signpost them to the specific tutorial or course they need. We check back in: "how was the course?" We look at data: "I saw you got 90% in that certification... congratulations!" We talk about next steps: "Would it help to meet someone who's built a real-time dynamically introspected front-end user-facing transcendental directed acyclic graph clickstream interface in AJAX before?"

DevRel needs to celebrate success, too. Cool kids work hard. Really hard. Their brains will not let them rest. Whatever potential is realised, it needs to be seen and privately celebrated. They might even get a cool bit of swag!

Seeing is bi-directional. Take engineering. Seeing enables feedback on contribution processes and on feature issues. Or take marketing and sales: has there been a rise in potential for a particular use case in a particular geography?

### Tutoring

Tutoring provides developers with a buddy to help them on their journey.

DevRel might spot someone raising questions and problems for the community to solve in some forum or other. It allows introductions to be made to exactly the right person to guide and coach. Someone who's been on that road before who can talk them through the pitfalls, hurdles, and barriers.

This isn't just about community support, it's also about speaking, writing, code contribution... all areas where there is potential. DevRel gives people hope amidst the Kerplunk sticks of darkness. Rich personal relationships are born, and feedback starts to flow freely and with evidence.

Developers are fanatical about realizing their potential. Without effective and proficient guides, you may well be left with a globally distributed group of highly intelligent individuals who feel they've been misled. And for developers, there's nothing more gut-wrenchingly destructive than the guilt and embarrassment that comes from believing *you* misled *yourself.* They will be more than willing to share that with anyone and everyone.

### Socialization

Seeing and Tutoring are only part of the process of combating isolation. Developers need to have places to meet people, and to build relationships with other developers.

Socialization is all about flexing and understanding the power of individuals and networks to generate – as Mark Herrera put it – "fanatical goodwill".

Through tutoring, DevRel makes itself available to answer questions, solve problems, and share knowledge out in the wild. Socialization activity encourages isolated individuals (who hardly ever respond to other people’s questions, complain when documentation fails them, and sternly tell authors that their code samples don't work) to be people who freely and willingly give back.

Socialization elevates the essential personal celebrations of success into group celebrations, like at meetups or on social media. It's part of the DevRel job to work out what level is appropriate, and to give that praise where it's due.

Yet there is a big barrier here. And this one affects me personally... You see, us developer-types find social situations unnerving. Ice-breaker activities are the stuff of nightmares. What I look for is other people saying "I'm OK, you're OK". It's OK to tell people what happened when you tried to build that acyclic graph and it didn't work first time. It's OK to tutor other people even though you're not as experienced as that person over there. It's OK to celebrate your successes. We're *all* OK.

DevRel is a source of role models – people with extreme levels of credibility who consistently display attitudes and behaviours exemplifying what it means to be a part of this OK Community. For those role models to be effective, and for these traits to become infectious, requires initiatives where they are elevated to a position where they can properly display that interdependency.

DevRel has an important role in creating situations where these characterstics of your community can be put on show. Discussion forums where people find causes to fight for (like fixing a security problem), where they find a place to tell campfire tales (like meetups), where group problem solving takes place (like hackathons).

Socialization provides the loud-hailers of credibility. Without these programs, there's no public celebration of those core capabilities and characteristics that the community professes to be founded on.

And, more seriously for open-source projects, it threatens to reduce the code to nothing more than an unloved cactus, consigned to the bin one cold morning.

Socialization provides the creative, energized spaces where capabilities are abstracted, where their applicability to other situations is expanded, where new approaches are generated, where patterns are spotted... where a fireworks display of brainpower keeps the core capabilities thrilling, exciting, and alive.

## Addendum: CASTS and AAA(+A)

It is super important, personally, for me to say that CASTS wouldn't exist without everyone else in DevRel having thought of a lot of this before me. That includes, particularly, [Rachel Pedreschi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelpedreschi?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAB2M3IBvRRWvukxKW-TrV8u8BwoRgc4yEc&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BeEHBKuRFTnaZSiFGE%2BZC%2Bw%3D%3D) and [Jelena Zanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelena-zanko?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAAPp9QB8oK8p6H9-iGtPGj1eXTf_tue5CQ&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BtMTCUy%2B4QCqpAkaM1dqYfA%3D%3D).

It was Rachel who first introduced the triple-A acronym to me:

* Awareness
    
* Adoption
    
* Attraction
    

(And out came my inner Cool Kid who wanted to add "Advancement").

You will undoubtedly have heard of these four, too. And it works. Rachel applied this model successfully throughout Round B, C, and D when we worked together, and there are no end of talks and blogs from DevRel written about it.

CASTS is slightly different:

* It's the relationship between Cool Kid, Seer, and Tutor that creates **awareness** at personal, interpersonal, and public levels. Here, it's *not* the result of a campaign. It's always troubled me that awareness in DevRel is the result of a Product Marketing, Technical Marketing, Developer Marketing, or &lt;insert here&gt; Marketing campaign. For me, the two are concretely distinct.
    
* **Adoption** in CASTS is the product of Seeing and Tutoring. Note that the developer persona for CASTS has likely already completed the POC *all in their mind* and has now moved on to the next problem to solve. We realize that they don't give a hooting banana about project plans, validation events, and risk logs. In the CASTS model, DevRel doesn't proactively track and report POCs.
    
* **Advocacy** occurs through socialization. It's not just creating the opportunity, however, it's the processes, tools, and role-modelling that drives potential implementers to *see their own potential* as an advocate, to celebrate their successes publicly... and to want other people to, too!
